# The More/Less Game

I coded this simple game in a coffee shop to initiate a good friend (med student) to programming with python.

As it is a simple project I decided not to split it in different files for less confusion. I also tried to use as many paradigms as I could (functions, classes, python built-in functions, etc...)

I hope it is fun to read for newbies getting into programming !

## Critics / Recommendations

Even on small projects there can always be recommendations about code readability, design, etc...

I would be glad to hear your opinion about what to improve in this little game.
